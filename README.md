# Gradients & Colour Mixing

A little [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/) project exploring various methods of making gradients, aside from the standard method of interpolating the RGB values.

Methods I explored: Linear interpolation, linear interpolation with an additively mixed midpoint, linear interpolation with a subtractively mixed midpoint, linear interpolation across the HSB/HSV cylinder, linear interpolation of the HSB/HSV values

This was in an attempt to find the correct mathematical approach, and also to make some pretty colours

### Run

You'll need [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/) with Python mode
